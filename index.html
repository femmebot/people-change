        &ldquo;I want you to know that people change&rdquo; presents text, photos and audio clips to tell the life story of my collaborator, Jamel, who is currently 32 years into a 62.5 year to life sentence. Underlying, the goal of this project is to give people a window into the personal changes that inevitably happen for people like Jamel, who are growing up and aging in prison.
